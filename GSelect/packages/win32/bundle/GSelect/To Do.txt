//IMPORTANT NOTES//
*******************

- Instead of saving settings.js in the same folder as app.js or one above app.js, save it using Ti.AppDirectory and then import that js file on start up

- Make changes to generateGamesList function in app.js and settingsWindowApp.js. Make it so that a fresh gameList is generated every time the function is
	called (To preserve the recent games played order). object check if its favourited and if so change the gameBlockHtml to change the image of favIcon
	cont.

- All the generateGameBlock (both for main app.js and settingsWindowApp.js) will need real value for the doesImageExists rather
	than a fake "true" value all the time.
	
- Also make it so that the images in both app.js and settingsWindowApp.js use the actual image set by user and the default one 
	from steam if no image was set by user
